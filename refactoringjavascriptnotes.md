 ### Technical Debt

 The cost of fixing all the erros and problems with the code base

* You need to have tests to verify that a certain behaviour dosesn't change to refactor

> “Writing tests takes too long. We’re moving too fast for that.”
> “It’s extra code to maintain.”
> “That’s what QA is for.”
> “It doesn’t catch enough errors.”
> “It doesn’t catch the important errors.”
> “This is just a little script/simple change. It doesn’t need a test.”
> “But the code works.”
> “The boss/client is paying for features, not tests.”
> “No one else on the team cares and will break the test suite and I’ll be trying to be Commissioner Gordon in a Gotham gone mad.”

## Reasons why you need to test (pg. 50)
* You are already doing it
* Refactoring is impossible without it
* It makes working with a team easier
* Tests are ideal for demonstrating functionality
* You are not just verifying the behaviour of your code but other people's code
* Tests are crucial for big upgrades
* You will catch bugs early
* Tests help smooth out development cycles
* Your feedback loop will be tighter

Testing is hard, you already wrote code now you have to write code that uses the code in a comprehensive and structured way. This leads on to the larger problem of writing quality software. This is a hard task but there are decades of work done on this to aid you.
